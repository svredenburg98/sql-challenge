# sql-challenge

In this project I analyzed employee and department data organized into separate CSV files. I first designed an ERD to find the necessary connections between the tables which would need to be incorporated into my SQL code. I then created six tables, linking keys between tables when necessary, then imported the CSV data into the tables, making sure to add them in the correct order so as to include primary keys before their references in other tables. 

Once all the tables were created and filled with data, I ran queries to investigate different aspects of the data. I queried the 'employees' and 'salaries' tables and joined them together, viewed the information of employees hired in 1986, looked at the information of all the department managers, looked at all of the employeed named 'Hercules B', looked at the sales and development departments, and listed the counts of all the employees' last names.
